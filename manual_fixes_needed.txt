URGENT MANUAL FIXES NEEDED FOR GameScene.js:

ERROR: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set') at line 5408

STEP 1: Restore the file first
- Rename GameScene.js.backup to GameScene.js

STEP 2: Remove this line from discoverArea method (around line 5407-5408):
DELETE THESE LINES:
    // === DYNAMIC FOG: Track visit time for regeneration system ===
    this.lastVisitedTimes.set(gridKey, this.time.now);

STEP 3: Remove these methods at the end of the file:
DELETE ENTIRE METHODS:
- regenerateOldFog()
- refogArea(gridKey) 
- createRefogEffect(x, y)

STEP 4: Update console logs to remove regeneration references:
FIND AND REMOVE/UPDATE:
- Any console.log mentioning "lastVisitedTimes" 
- Any console.log mentioning "regeneration"
- Any console.log mentioning "45 seconds"

This will fix the fog regeneration system and make discovered areas stay permanently clear!
